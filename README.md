# DivergenceMeter
IN-14 and IN-16 Nixie divergence meter software. 

This is seeded from a clone of the Tom Titor Divergence meter project software version 1.05. http://www.mindspring.com/~tomtitor/#programcode

Branched to add a feature where the clock display can be replaced by a changing divergence value instead of a clock.
